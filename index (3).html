I heard there was a secret chord<br>
That David played and it pleased the Lord<br>
But you don't really care for music, do you?<br>
Well, it goes like this: The fourth, the fifth<br>
The minor fall and the major lift<br>
The baffled king composing Hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:lightgreen;">
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof<br>
You saw her bathing on the roof<br>
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya<br>
She tied you to her kitchen chair<br>
She broke your throne and she cut your hair<br>
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:lightgreen;">
Baby, I've been here before<br>
I've seen this room and I've walked this<br>
floor, you know<br>
I used to live alone before I knew ya<br>
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch<br>
And love is not a victory march<br>
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:lightgreen;">
There was a time when you let me know<br>
What's really going on below<br>
But now you never show that to me, do you?<br>
But remember when I moved in you<br>
And the holy dove was moving too<br>
And every breath we drew was hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:lightgreen;">
Maybe there's a God above<br>
But all I've ever learned from love<br>
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya<br>
And it's not a cry that you hear at night<br>
It's not somebody who's seen the light<br>
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:#FFFF00;">
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
